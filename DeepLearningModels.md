This image illustrates a taxonomy of deep learning models, categorized into three main types: **Generative (Unsupervised)**, **Discriminative (Supervised)**, and **Hybrid**.

1. **Generative (Unsupervised)** models are those that learn to generate data or predict missing values in an unsupervised manner. Under this category, we see:
   - **Auto Encoder (AE)**: A model used for learning efficient data encoding. Variants include:
     - **Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE)**: A multi-layered version of the autoencoder.
     - **Denoising Auto Encoder (DAE)**: A version of AE designed to remove noise from data.
     - **Stacked DAE (SDAE)**: A multi-layered DAE for improved denoising performance.
   - **Sum-Product Network (SPN)**: A probabilistic model based on a deep architecture for computing complex probability distributions.
   - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A model designed for sequential data, such as time series.
   - **Boltzmann Machine (BM)**: A probabilistic model that learns data representations by minimizing energy functions. Variants include:
     - **Deep BM (DBM)**: A deep version of the Boltzmann machine.
     - **Restricted BM (RBM)**: A simplified version of BM with restricted connections.
     - **Deep Belief Network (DBN)**: A model that stacks RBMs to form deep architectures.

2. **Discriminative (Supervised)** models focus on predicting labels from input data, mainly used for classification tasks. The key model here is:
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A model primarily used for tasks involving image data, capturing spatial hierarchies in the data.

3. **Hybrid** models combine features from both generative and discriminative approaches:
   - **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A broad class of models with multiple hidden layers used for various deep learning tasks.

The image also includes a note mentioning **SPN** as Sum-Product Network and **RNN** as Recurrent Neural Network.

This diagram effectively shows how deep learning architectures are grouped based on their learning strategies and specific use cases.
